Functional
==========
X Split code to library and cli
X  - main should be a cli facade over the library

X Add option to check for program update

X Add unit tests

Add functional tests
 - Various combinations of env vars
 - Various combinations of config file attrs
 - Various combinations of cmdline options
 - Various combinations of the above
 - session tokens and assume role without mfa (testing with MFA requires user interaction)
 -- consider cucumber or rspec for test execution (go test -json won't work, since it's not junit-compatible)

X Document code

X Provide better integration with AWS SDK env vars (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/)
X  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_ACCESS_KEY     (used by runas to interact with AWS up to getting session token, output session token or assume role creds)
X  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / AWS_SECRET_KEY (used by runas to interact with AWS up to getting session token, output session token or assume role creds)
X  - AWS_SESSION_TOKEN / AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN (provide as output, but not supported during runas execution)
X  - AWS_REGION / AWS_DEFAULT_REGION   (not super important for runas, but should pass value through)
X  - AWS_PROFILE / AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE (used by runas to lookup profile info, should pass value through)
X  - AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE (used by runas to lookup profile info, should pass value through)
X  - AWS_CONFIG_FILE             (used by runas to lookup profile info, should pass value through)

X Support setting session and assume role cred durations in config file (and env vars?)
X  - shared config file supported attributes (see https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/master/aws/session/shared_config.go)
X    -- credential attributes (don't support in our app ... force shared credentials file use)
X    - aws_access_key_id
X    - aws_secret_access_key (required if access key is set)
X    - aws_session_token
X    -- assume role
X    - role_arn
X    - source_profile (required if role arn is set)
X    - external_id
X    - mfa_serial
X    - role_session_name
X    -- other
X    - region
X
X    -- NEW (aws-runas specific ... both values provided as golang duration strings to match cli)
X    - session_token_duration (explicitly describe these as session token settings)
X    - credentials_duration   (keeping a similar convention as other assume role config attrs)


Non-Functional
===============
X Move repo
X  - make this the 'official' aws-runas repo, move & deprecate python version

Update project README

Integrate with external tools
 - AWS code build/pipeline, CircleCI, Travis, Concourse, etc...
   - Going to land on Circle for the time being ... will be broken until we merge release/1.0 branch to master

Submit project to awesome-go list
