Functional
==========
X Split code to library and cli
X  - main should be a cli facade over the library

X Add option to check for program update

X Add unit tests

Add functional tests
 - Various combinations of env vars
 - Various combinations of config file attrs
 - Various combinations of cmdline options
 - Various combinations of the above
 - session tokens and assume role with and without mfa

X Document code

Provide better integration with AWS SDK env vars (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/)
 - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_ACCESS_KEY     (used by runas to interact with AWS up to getting session token, output session token or assume role creds)
 - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / AWS_SECRET_KEY (used by runas to interact with AWS up to getting session token, output session token or assume role creds)
 - AWS_SESSION_TOKEN / AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN (provide as output, but not supported during runas execution)
 - AWS_REGION / AWS_DEFAULT_REGION   (not super important for runas, but should pass value through)
 - AWS_PROFILE / AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE (used by runas to lookup profile info, should pass value through)
 - AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE (used by runas to lookup profile info, should pass value through)
 - AWS_CONFIG_FILE             (used by runas to lookup profile info, should pass value through)

Support setting session and assume role cred durations in config file (and env vars?)
 - shared config file supported attributes (see https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/master/aws/session/shared_config.go)
   -- credential attributes (don't support in our app ... force shared credentials file use)
   - aws_access_key_id
   - aws_secret_access_key (required if access key is set)
   - aws_session_token
   -- assume role
   - role_arn
   - source_profile (required if role arn is set)
   - external_id
   - mfa_serial
   - role_session_name
   -- other
   - region

   -- NEW (aws-runas specific)
   - session_token_duration_minutes (explicitly describe these as session token settings)
   - credentials_duration_minutes   (keeping a similar convention as other assume role config attrs)


Non-Functional
===============
X Move repo
X  - make this the 'official' aws-runas repo, move & deprecate python version

Integrate with external tools
 - AWS code pipeline, CircleCI, Travis, Concourse, etc...
